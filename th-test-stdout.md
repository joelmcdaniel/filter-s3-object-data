# Filtering JSON from S3

## Introduction

The ****** MAF (M***** Analysis Framework) processes many types of media as well as metadata that is extracted from media. Most of the metadata is represented as a sequence of [newline-delimited JSON](http://ndjson.org) objects. This simply means that the JSON objects are encoded without newlines (`'\n'`), and are separated by either a newline (`'\n'`) or a carriage-return (`'\r'`) followed by a newline (`'\n'`).

This technical assessment will evaluate your skills in [The Go Programming Language](https://golang.org), your ability to work with the [AWS SDK for Go](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go), and your ability to create a [Docker](https://docker.com).

## Data

There are a number of objects in [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) that contain newline-delimited JSON data. Each JSON object contains several fields:

| Name | JSON Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------------|
| `id` | `number` | A randomly generated 64-bit integer identifier. |
| `time` | `string` | A string containing an [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp. |
| `words` | `array` | An array of strings containing randomly selected English words. |

Some examples of data:

```json
{"id":5559641812032348625,"time":"1973-03-26T06:18:27.894733102-08:00","words":["scarfing","chip","nuke"]}
{"id":2700778169311697635,"time":"2000-04-12T06:50:23.866113335-06:00","words":["bouncier"]}
{"id":3622438848630508647,"time":"1994-04-15T11:12:04.921735153-06:00","words":["payoffs","winters"]}
{"id":6022900352107475984,"time":"2008-11-24T05:28:08.519322526-08:00","words":["astringency","entertain"]}
```

The objects in S3 are GZIP compressed, and can be arbitrarily large up to the S3 size limit (5 TiB).

## S3 Inputs

| S3 URI | Number of JSON |
| ------ | -------------- |
| s3://s3filter-`***-****-*****-******`-com/1k.ndjson.gz | 1000 |
| s3://s3filter-`***-****-*****-******`-com/10k.ndjson.gz | 10000 |
| s3://s3filter-`***-****-*****-******`-com/100k.ndjson.gz | 100000 |
| s3://s3filter-`***-****-*****-******`-com/1M.ndjson.gz | 1000000 |
| s3://s3filter-`***-****-*****-******`-com/10M.ndjson.gz | 10000000 |

## Task

Your task for this exercise is to build a utility in Go, packaged as an executable Docker image, that filters the data from an object in S3, and prints the result to `stdout`.

## Flags

The utility that you develop must support the following flags:

| Name | Required | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `-input` | Yes | An S3 URI (`s3://{bucket}/{key}`) that refers to the source object to be filtered. |
| `-with-id` | No | An integer that contains the `id` of a JSON object to be selected. |
| `-from-time` | No | An RFC3339 timestamp that represents the earliest `time` of a JSON object to be selected. |
| `-to-time` | No | An RFC3339 timestamp that represents the latest `time` of JSON object to be selected. |
| `-with-word` | No | A string containing a word that must be contained in `words` of a JSON objec to be selected. |

If no `-input` flag is present, the utility should print a usage message and exit with a non-zero status. If only the `-input` flag is present, the output of the S3 object should be written to `stdout`. The `-with-id` flag should select only JSON objects that have the specified `id` field. The `-from-time` flag should select only objects with `time` fields greater than or equal to the specified value. The `-to-time` flag should select only objects with `time` fields less than the specified value. Finally, the `-with-word` flag should select only object where the `words` array contains the specified word. If multiple filtering flags are provided, the conjunction (AND) of the conditions should be applied.

## Examples

```bash
docker run --rm -e AWS_REGION -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ******/s3filter -input s3://s3filter-s3filter-***-****-*****-******-com/1k.ndjson.gz -from-time=2000-01-01T00:00:00Z -to-time=2001-01-01T00:00:00Z

## Requirements
1. You must write the utility in Go and compile with version `1.13` or later.
2. You must use Go modules for dependency management.
3. You may use packages from the Go standard library, and the AWS SDK for Go.
4. You must use the standard [AWS SDK mechanism(s) for obtaining credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session). In other words, just do `session.NewSession()`, and let the SDK do the rest.
5. You must provide a `Dockerfile` that builds an executable container image for your utility.
6. Your utility must *not* use local storage within the container.
